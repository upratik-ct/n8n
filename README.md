n8n (short for “Node-Node”) is a powerful open-source workflow automation tool designed for technical teams and developers. It allows users to connect various apps and services using a visual interface, enabling the creation of complex, automated workflows without writing full applications.

Unlike other no-code tools, n8n offers full access to JavaScript functions, custom code, and API integrations — making it both flexible and developer-friendly. With support for over 400 integrations (including GitHub, Slack, and databases), n8n is suitable for automating backend jobs, syncing data, and orchestrating CI/CD pipelines.

It can be self-hosted or used in the cloud, providing full data ownership and extensibility. Thanks to its open-source nature and active community, n8n is continuously evolving and widely adopted by modern engineering teams.
